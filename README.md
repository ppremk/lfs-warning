# LFS-Warning action

This action works to prevent both:

- Large files that are not LFS tracked
- Files that are LFS tracked

from being checked-in in non-pointer format/not stored in LFS. The latter happens if the client does not have git-lfs installed.

## How it works

This action scans files in commits of a pull request and will mark the pull request as failed, add a `lfs-detected!` label and reply with an issue comment if any of the following is true about any of the pull request files:

- The file size is greater than the configured file size limit threshold.
- The file is tracked in LFS but is being checked-in as a regular file
  - the current implementation of this check is that the file has git attribute `filter: lfs` but does not contain the string `version https://git-lfs.github.com/spec/v1`

Note: Remember to configure the branch protection rule and select the `LFS-warning` status when you enable the `Required status check to pass` option.
